PROJECT TITLE:  Histogram

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  A coin is flipped 6 times. If it lands on heads, the
fish swims forwards, if tails, it swims backwards. When it lands on a final
position (either -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, or 6), it records the position and
repeats the process as many times as the user chooses. At the end of all this,
the program prints out the statistics for each landing and shows a histogram
with red blocks visually diagramming the difference in the results between each landing.

VERSION or DATE:  1/26/2014

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Within BlueJ, compile the project, if
necessary (see next paragraph).  Then right-click (or control-click)
on the SimpleGridObjectApp class.  Select "void main(String[] args)", then
click on "Ok".

If a Java class needs to be compiled, BlueJ indicates this by
painting stripes across the class's icon.  You can compile a single class
from its editor window by clicking on the Compile button at the top of that
window.  Alternatively, you can compile all classes in the project by
clicking on the Compile button in the toolbar to the left of the central
icon diagram for the project.  (Actually, BlueJ will check which classes
need to be compiled and compile only those.)

AUTHORS: Noah Getz, based on a template by Alyce Brady and Kelly Schultz

USER INSTRUCTIONS:  This application does everything it needs to do on its own,
so there is nothing for the user to do other than to compile and start the project,
as described above.
